This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system for e-commerce data using Kafka, Machine Learning, and Django. Incoming order data is streamed through Kafka, where an Isolation Forest model and business rules detect pricing anomalies such as abnormal discounts. Detected anomalies are published to a Kafka topic, stored in PostgreSQL for historical analysis, and simultaneously pushed to the frontend using Django Channels and WebSockets. An Angular dashboard consumes these real-time updates to display anomalies instantly, providing both live monitoring and persistent auditability.
